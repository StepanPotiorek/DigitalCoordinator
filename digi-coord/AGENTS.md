# AGENT.md — Filipino Workforce Coordination System

## Project Overview

**Digital Coordinator** is a full-stack web application for coordinating Filipino workers in the Czech Republic. It replaces manual WhatsApp-based coordination with an automated system for onboarding, adaptation support, issue tracking, and communication.

### Core Value Proposition

> "I provide Czech-side Filipino workforce coordination supported by my own onboarding app."

### What the App Does

- Worker onboarding & adaptation support
- Self-service FAQ to reduce repeated questions
- Practical tool for Czech clients to see coordination in action
- Positions the role as "coordination + systems," not just personal support

### Target Audience & Content Strategy (Universal + Local)

The app is designed for **Filipino workers across all of Czech Republic** — not tied to any single city.

- **~80 % universal content** — works for every Filipino in CZ (Employee Card, Bank Account, SIM, Healthcare, Workplace Culture, Communication, Worker Help)
- **~20 % local/city-specific content** — each worker selects their city (Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň, etc.) during registration. In future, content like "transport apps per region" or "local OAMP office" can adapt based on city field.
- City field (`Worker.city`) stored in database, displayed on profile, used in registration/edit forms
- Transport: **IDOS** + **Google Maps** are nationwide; removed app-specific refs (PID Lítačka, ČD Můj vlak, Mapy.cz)
- Banks: generic list (AirBank, Česká spořitelna, ČSOB, KB, Moneta, Raiffeisenbank) — no branch-specific nearby search

### What the App Does NOT Handle

- Visas and immigration legal processing
- Legal documents and contracts
- Official fees
- Personal airport pickup

## Database Schema (Prisma + SQLite)

### Models

```
User (id, name, email, passwordHash, role: ADMIN|COORDINATOR|CLIENT, createdAt, updatedAt)
Worker (id, name, whatsapp, email?, employer?, accommodation?, arrivalDate?, emergencyContactName?, emergencyContactPhone?, onboardingStatus: PENDING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED, createdAt, updatedAt)
OnboardingItem (id, workerId FK, label, category: BEFORE_ARRIVAL|AFTER_ARRIVAL|FIRST_DAY|..., completed, completedAt?)
Issue (id, workerId FK, issueType, description, priority: LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|URGENT, status: OPEN|IN_PROGRESS|RESOLVED, createdAt, updatedAt)
Accommodation (id, workerId FK unique, address, room?, rules?, contactName?, contactPhone?, mapUrl?, createdAt, updatedAt)
Client (id, name, contactEmail?, contactPhone?, notes?, userId FK? unique, createdAt, updatedAt)
CommunicationLog (id, workerId FK, clientId FK?, type: NOTE|ISSUE_UPDATE|ONBOARDING_UPDATE|GENERAL, message, createdBy, createdAt)
FAQ (id, question, answer, category?, order, createdAt, updatedAt)
```

### Relationships

- Worker has many OnboardingItems, Issues, CommunicationLogs
- Worker has one Accommodation
- Client has many CommunicationLogs
- User (auth) can be ADMIN, COORDINATOR, or linked to Client

---

## Authentication Strategy

- **NextAuth.js v5** with **Credentials** provider
- Roles: `ADMIN`, `COORDINATOR`, `CLIENT`
- Login page at `/login`
- Protected routes via middleware + `getServerSession`
- Seed default admin (change password on first deploy)

---

## Implementation Roadmap

Tasks are in `ROADMAP/` directory, numbered and independent. Each task file contains:

- **Description**: What to build
- **Prompt for AI**: Copy-paste ready instructions for an AI coding assistant
- **Files to create/modify**: Exact file paths
- **API endpoints**: Request/response format
- **UI components**: What to render
- **Database changes**: Prisma schema changes if needed

### Task Order

| # | File | Feature |
|---|------|---------|
| 00 | `ROADMAP/00-init.md` | Project setup, Prisma init, env config, seed |
| 01 | `ROADMAP/01-auth.md` | Authentication system (NextAuth, login, middleware) |
| 02 | `ROADMAP/02-workers.md` | Worker CRUD (API + pages + registration form) |
| 03 | `ROADMAP/03-onboarding.md` | Onboarding checklist (API + UI + progress) |
| 04 | `ROADMAP/04-accommodation.md` | Accommodation section (API + UI) |
| 05 | `ROADMAP/05-issues.md` | Issue reporting (API + form + admin view) |
| 06 | `ROADMAP/06-guide-pages.md` | Public guide pages (Before/After Arrival, First Day, FAQ, Contact, Worker Guide) |
| 07 | `ROADMAP/07-client-dashboard.md` | Client dashboard (worker status, issues, notes) |
| 08 | `ROADMAP/08-admin-dashboard.md` | Admin dashboard (overview, stats, follow-ups) |
| 09 | `ROADMAP/09-deployment.md` | Production build, PM2, backup strategy |

## Design Guidelines

- **Layout**: Dark background (slate-950), glass-morphism cards, gradient hero sections
- **Components**: Reusable, composable, server components where possible
- **Forms**: Client components with `useActionState` or controlled state
- **API**: RESTful, JSON responses, error handling with proper status codes
- **Auth**: Server-side session checks, redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated
- **Mobile**: Fully responsive, mobile-first design
- **Language**: UI in English (default), content supports English + Czech phrases

---

## Important Conventions

- NEVER add comments to code unless explicitly asked
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use Prisma for all database access
- Use Next.js App Router patterns (server components by default)
- Keep components small and focused
- Reuse existing UI patterns and color scheme from the old app
- All text content visible to the public needs no auth
- Dashboard/admin routes require authentication
- SQLite file stored at `prisma/dev.db` (dev) or configured via `DATABASE_URL` env (prod)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Production build
npx next build

# Tests
npm run test          # vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # playwright e2e tests

# Seed database
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# === Dev Server Reliable Restart ===
# setsid is REQUIRED — nohup does NOT survive bash tool timeout/kill
# Use these exact commands every time you restart.

# One-liner (kill + clean + start):
kill $(lsof -ti:3000) 2>/dev/null; rm -rf .next; setsid sh -c 'cd /home/stepan/Documents/programming/digital-coordinator/digi-coord && exec npx next dev -H 127.0.0.1 > /tmp/digicoord-dev.log 2>&1' &

# Step by step:
kill $(lsof -ti:3000) 2>/dev/null   # kill old server
rm -rf /home/stepan/Documents/programming/digital-coordinator/digi-coord/.next  # clean turbopack cache
setsid sh -c 'cd /home/stepan/Documents/programming/digital-coordinator/digi-coord && exec npx next dev -H 127.0.0.1 > /tmp/digicoord-dev.log 2>&1' &  # start detached

# Verify (poll up to 10s):
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do fuser 3000/tcp 2>/dev/null && echo "OK ($((i))s)" && break; sleep 1; done

# Check logs:
tail -20 /tmp/digicoord-dev.log

# === Deploy to production server ===
# Server: root@rdev.buq.cz, project: /opt/digi-coord/
# Builds locally, rsyncs files, rebuilds Docker container
cd /home/stepan/Documents/programming/digital-coordinator/digi-coord
bash deploy.sh
```

## Current Session Context

### Login flow — definitive version (all tests passing)

**Architecture:**
- Login page: `src/app/login/page.tsx` (server, reads `searchParams.error`)
- Login form: `src/app/login/login-form.tsx` (client, form `action="/api/auth/login" method="POST"`)
- Route handler: `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` — calls `signIn("credentials", { redirect: false })` then `NextResponse.redirect("/dashboard", 303)`
- Auth config: `src/lib/auth.ts` — explicit `secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET`, JWT strategy, session maxAge 10 years

**Critical insight — proxy.ts is middleware:**
- `src/proxy.ts` with `export function proxy()` + `export const config` is detected as middleware/proxy by Next.js 16
- Old `proxy.ts` used `getToken()` from `next-auth/jwt` which failed in edge runtime — **deleted**
- New `proxy.ts` (re-created) uses a simpler approach: checks for cookie `next-auth.session-token` existence, no JWT decode needed
- Auth still verified server-side by `dashboard/layout.tsx` calling `auth()` — proxy just prevents unnecessary JS downloads for unauthenticated visitors

**Key lessons:**
- **Never use 307 redirect after POST login** — 307 preserves POST method; browser POSTs to `/dashboard` which fails. Use **303 See Other** instead
- **Set-Cookie from fetch() or signIn() response is fragile in Playwright** — the old proxy.ts middleware was the actual root cause, not cookie handling
- **Explicit `secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET`** in NextAuth config prevents issues with auto-detection
- **Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` convention** (not `middleware.ts`) with `export function proxy`
- **Service worker caches JS** — `public/sw.js` cached JS/CSS with `digicoord-v1`, never invalidated on deploy. Fixed by bumping to v2 and removing `js|css` from fetch regex

### Files changed this session:
- `src/proxy.ts`: **recreated** — auth proxy, cookie-check based (no JWT decode), early redirect to `/login`
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`: redirect `/` → `/login`
- `docker-compose.yml`: `environment:` → `env_file: .env.production`
- `Makefile`: added `dev-restart` target
- `public/sw.js`: cache version `v2`, removed `js|css` from fetch-cache regex
- `src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx`: simplified UI — no filters, card layout, readable action names
- `.gitignore`: added root `dev.db`

### Session 2 — City field + Content universalization

**Vision:** 80 % universal content for all Filipinos in CZ, 20 % local/city-specific via `Worker.city` field.

**Changes:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: added `city String?` to Worker model
- `src/lib/validation.ts`: added `city` to both `createWorkerSchema` and `updateWorkerSchema`
- `src/components/forms/worker-registration-form.tsx`: added city input field
- `src/app/dashboard/workers/new/new-worker-form.tsx`: added city input
- `src/app/dashboard/workers/[id]/edit/edit-worker-form.tsx`: added city field
- `src/app/api/workers/route.ts`: save city on worker create
- `src/app/api/workers/[id]/route.ts`: save city on worker update
- `src/app/api/worker/me/route.ts`: return city in GET, accept city in PUT
- `src/app/dashboard/worker/profile/page.tsx`: display city
- `src/app/after-arrival/page.tsx`: banks → generic list (AirBank, ČS, ČSOB, KB, Moneta, RB); nearby search → "Find banks nearby on Google Maps"; transport → IDOS + Google Maps
- `src/app/first-day/page.tsx`: "Use PID Lítačka app" → "Use Google Maps to find the best route and buy tickets / Download your regional transit app"
- `src/lib/situations.ts`: PID Lítačka/ČD Můj vlak/Mapy.cz → Google Maps / your regional transit app (8 edits across buy-ticket, lost-ticket, missed-bus, directions)
- `src/i18n/en.json`, `cz.json`, `tl.json`: added `form.city` translations
- `prisma/migrations/`: fresh initial migration (squashed drift). NOTE: prisma dev database was reset — seed re-run (`npx tsx prisma/seed.ts`)
- `AGENTS.md`: added "Target Audience & Content Strategy (Universal + Local)" section

### Session 3 — 📬 My Letters (V1 + V2 combined)

**Feature:** Workers can browse a static letter category guide or upload a photo for AI analysis.
- Only for logged-in workers (`/dashboard/worker/letters/`)
- V1: 6 categories (🏛️ Ministry of Interior, 🏥 Health Insurance, 🏦 Bank, 🏢 Employer, 🏠 Accommodation, 📮 Other)
- V2: Upload photo → Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision API → JSON with sender, purpose, actionRequired, deadline, explanation
- "Other / Unknown" category → "Contact your coordinator immediately"
- AI is optional (via `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var; if not set, static guide still works)
- Letter history with delete support

**New files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: added `Letter` model (`id, workerId, sender?, purpose?, actionRequired?, deadline?, explanation?, photoPath, mimeType, aiRaw?, aiConfidence?, createdAt`)
- `src/lib/letter-guides.ts`: static guide data for 6 categories
- `src/lib/gemini.ts`: Gemini REST API client (`analyzeLetterWithGemini`)
- `src/app/api/worker/me/letters/route.ts`: GET (list) + POST (upload + AI analyze)
- `src/app/api/worker/me/letters/[id]/route.ts`: GET (detail) + DELETE
- `src/app/api/ai/analyze-letter/route.ts`: standalone AI analyze endpoint
- `src/app/dashboard/worker/letters/page.tsx`: full client component (grid/category/upload/result/history views)

**Modified files:**
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-shell.tsx`: added "📬 My Letters" nav link for WORKER role
- `src/app/dashboard/worker/page.tsx`: added "📬 My Letters" journey card + bottom link
- `src/app/api/media/[filename]/route.ts`: added "letters" to search dirs

**AI integration:**
- Provider: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (REST API, no SDK needed)
- Env: `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional)
- Prompt asks for structured JSON output
- Only images (not PDF) are sent to Gemini for analysis
- Falls back gracefully if API key not set

### Known issues:
- WhatsApp Callmebot not activated — send "I allow callmebot" from +420777654279 to +34 644 45 70 57
- Seed DB in Dockerfile (`db-init` stage) always runs `prisma seed`, could overwrite fresh data on first volume creation
- **Migration reset on dev:** old migrations were squashed into single `20260605121859_init` — production database must be handled with care (backup before deploy)
- Gemini only analyzes images (not PDFs) — PDF uploads are stored but not analyzed
